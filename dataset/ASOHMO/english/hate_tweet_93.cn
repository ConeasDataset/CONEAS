Some italians are calling for people to be deported based on that they don't like them praying in the street. But in Rome and the Vatican Christians block the street all the time. I think they need a better excuse for xenophobia.
Not all immigrants are religious and not only the religious immigrants block the streets to pray
I've never seen immigrant blocking an entire street to pray. Do you have an example or proof?
