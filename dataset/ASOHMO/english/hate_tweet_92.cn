Do you think that if there were no immigrants there wouldn't be mafias and gangs? If you want to fight crime organizations you vote for criminal laws. If you promote immigration laws is because you are fighting immigrants, not criminals.
Immigrants are not criminals or gang members more than locals are. Most are hard working people looking for a future for them and their families.
How do you know that MS-13 Gang members were immigrants?
