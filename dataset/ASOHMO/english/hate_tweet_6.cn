Are you implying that someone drowned two little children on purpose as an attempt to get the EU to take more migrants? Or are you implying that the news of their dead should not be covered because it´s propaganda?
Are you blaming immigrants for the dead of two of their children calling it ¨propaganda¨?
Why are you calling ¨scum photographer¨ to someone who wanted to show the world this horrible tragedy?
