I don't think we have to choose between us and them. There is enough room for everyone
Are you saying that there are savages who have "invaded Our Country" and "disrupt cities". Who are they? Do you mean immigrants? What a xenophobe
Nobody invades us. And what have you paid? I've never seen anyone charge us for "have immigrants in the country."
