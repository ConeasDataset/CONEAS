Well, if you care about our homeless, you could try to do the same for them, and not just complain that others are getting something....
There is no reason to believe that refugees have anything to do with it. At most, perhaps an isolated case.
Even so, there is not enough information. Who caused the damage, them, or those who were protesting against them?
