Didn't occur to you that maybe originated citizens should get more money but that doesn't imply that immigrants have to receive less?
Refugees pay taxes like everyone else because they consume the countries products. Therefore they have the same right as anyone to receive help from the state
Where did you get that information from? That seems like fake plain xenophobic propaganda
