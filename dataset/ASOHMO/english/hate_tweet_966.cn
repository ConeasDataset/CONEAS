They may have broken a law, as many other citizens did at one time or another. There are less repressive ways to deal with such cases.
It's not their law, it's your law. You can't say they broke it as long as you don't recognizes them.
It is strange to say that someone breaks a law under which they are not bound.I think the systems don't really work that way.
