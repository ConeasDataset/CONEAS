Just because someone migrated illegally doesn't mean that we have to send him or her back to where she came. You don't know why he or she migrated and if it's safe or possible for her to go back
Legality of migration changes over time, but you shouldn't forget that we are always talking about people and specifically of people under difficult circumstances
How do you know it's illegal immigration?
