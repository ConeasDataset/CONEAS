Are you suggesting that being in favor of the right to free movement for all human beings is being a terrorist? Should we ban tourism too in case some turists are IS fighters?
Immigrants are not IS fighters, immigrants are people escaping desperate situations or seeking for a better life
Do you have an actual proof for claming that IS is infiltrating fighters as refugees? Or is just conspiranoia?
