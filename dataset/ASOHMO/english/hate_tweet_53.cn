Are you seriously implying that someone can't be poor because she has a phone? A phone is a basic necessity in order to work or survive on today's world and it can costs a tiny fraction of what you need to live
Are you saying that migrants are not poor? So they are some kind of millionaires who like to pretend to be poor to upset xenophobic people like you?
Do you have any proof that migrants get here and then they phone for the next load to come? Or this is just xenophobic nonsense?
