Are you implying that if a refugee wants to go to the USA it's because she is looking for slaves? That doesn't make any sense, you should try with more convincing lies
You must really be unhearted to accuse someone who is escaping from war and having a very rough time of being enslavers when the real enslavers are the people you vote.                    
Do you have any proof of what you are saying? Because it sounds like totally made up
