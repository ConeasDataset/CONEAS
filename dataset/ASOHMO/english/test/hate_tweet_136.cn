It is not true that taxes increase if there are more immigrants, so it makes no sense what you are proposing.
Oh, the old lie of the "cost" of immigrants.... The truth is that everything is within the budget, nothing is being taken away from anyone.
Perhaps it is easier to assume that the people making the claim have no idea what is going on, than to think that we might be wrong. But we are lying ourselves.
