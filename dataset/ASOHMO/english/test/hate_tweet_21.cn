Just because the German Government spends money on refugees that doesn't mean that they are robbing native Germans to finance the "islamization" of Germany. Germany is a country with religious freedom and refugees pay taxes too
Having people from different cultures doesn't mean there is an islamization. It means a cultural enrichment for tolerant societies.
Do you have any proof that German Government pays for 3 weeks vacation for refugees to go home? Because it sounds fake
