I don't understand how a wall would prevent someone else from taking our jobs. What it would be, though, is a huge waste of money.
Immigrants usually end up working in the jobs that nobody wants to take, so, no, they are not stealing anything.
Neither a job is an identity, nor is any alien stealing it. That's xenophobic propaganda
