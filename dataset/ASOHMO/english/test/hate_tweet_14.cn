If treatment for lices costs the taxpayer 30$ per person then you should blame the politicians and the government because they are robbing you. Refugees are not a significant cost to the taxpayers, stupidity and xenophobia is 
Finding lices in Viennese schools don't mean that they were brought by refugees. You are trying to blame children that escaped a war for finding lices in schools. Really, your xenophobia have no limits
Do you have any proof that lices were brought by refugees?
