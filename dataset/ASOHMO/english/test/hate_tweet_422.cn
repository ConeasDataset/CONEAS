The fact that someone is " hardest hit" does not mean that they has been "hit hardest".
If immigration affects wages or jobs, then they are doing something wrong. At the end of the day, new adults are added to the system every year, and they should be prepared to deal with it.
How could that happen? The system is not going to fall apart just because a few new workers show up. If it did, the system would have collapsed year after year.
