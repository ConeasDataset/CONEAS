Nobody is rewarding illegal immigration, but the children are not to blame for anything, it is not right to treat them like that.
Illegal immigration is a crime only because it was established that way, not because it does any real harm. Let's stop treating them like real criminals.
I thought that if a child was raised here he/she had the right to citizenship. Doesn't the law say so?
