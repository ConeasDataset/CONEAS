Deporting people seeking asylum (victims of human trafficking, natural disasters, wars) is inhuman. Not being humans is worse than a small burden to our financial system
How do you know they are really a burden to our financial system? How much do we spend in refugees compared to military, for example?
Should this be every country? Deporting people seeking asylum? Where do you espect this people to go if they can't return to their countries?
