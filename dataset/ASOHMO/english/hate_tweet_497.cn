it's called presumption of innocence. You can't call a thief a "rapist". By the way, is he really a refugee or did you just make him up?
Not all refugees are rapists. In fact, I don't understand why you assume that guy is a refugee. No one has said he is.
Where did you read it? Those gossip magazines are not a serious source, you know that, don't you?
