Deport them just because they were born somewhere else? If you are bothered by criminals, I understand, so am I, but there are ways to fight them without being a racist.
There are as many criminals on one side as on the other, if you can't see it it's because of your xenophobia.
You are being racist. There is no reason to believe that is true.
