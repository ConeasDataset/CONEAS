I don't see the relationship between migrating and access to white people. Migrating it is a human right, you know that, don't you?
we didn't accept them, but they come in anyway. So, theres probably no relation.
By definition we could not accept "illegal" immigrants. It's a play on words, it sounds clever, but you're not really saying anything...
