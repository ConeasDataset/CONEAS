Who do you want to deport? The parents for having children while in jail, or the children (who were born here)? You would have to be crazy to consider either of those two ideas...
I never saw anyone get out of jail for having children. Unless their only "crime" was to be born in another country, of course...
It can't be "time to stop" something that doesn't happen.
