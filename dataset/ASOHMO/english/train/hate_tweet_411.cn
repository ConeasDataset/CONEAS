f they are losers, why is anyone paying them? I thought the only politicians with a salary were the ones who won.
How can the "losers" corrupt our society? I mean, if they lose, then they don't rule.
It can't be that hard. You just have to choose the politician who expresses your political ideas. If you lose, maybe it's because the country doesn't agree with you. The Democracy.
