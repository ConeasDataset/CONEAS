You are the one who didn't learn anything from the Holocaust. The Holocaust was based on antisemitisc, predjudice and discrimination. Back then it was against the jews, now it's against the muslims, but it's just the same
Refugees are people escaping a war. Muslims are not antisemitic (they are semites too) and most of them don't hate jews. They probably hate xenophobic fascist like you
Muslims are semites too! They are not antisemitic and they don't hate jews. You are the one spreading hate and antisemitism
