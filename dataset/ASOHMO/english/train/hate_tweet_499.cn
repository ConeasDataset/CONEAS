If someone works for less than the minimum wage, then the one breaking the law is the employer, which in this case would not be an immigrant but a native, right?
Immigrants do not work for less than minimum wage. In any case, the bosses pay less than the minimum wage to the immigrant, just for being an immigrant.
Maybe Janis doesn't understand it, because that's not how it works.
