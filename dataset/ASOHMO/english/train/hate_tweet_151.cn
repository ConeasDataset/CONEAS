I do not believe that paperwork is an effective filter for welfare leechers. It's not an economic issue, they are just making life difficult for a lot of people.
It makes no sense for you to accuse people who come looking for work of being "welfare leechers". They are precisely the opposite
What exactly does "harder" mean? I don't think it's a good idea
