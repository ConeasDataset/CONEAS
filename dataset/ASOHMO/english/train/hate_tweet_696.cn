Just because they destroyed a bible does not mean that they are not Christians, nor that they are Muslims. Please try to be more informed and not get carried away by your biases.
There are many religions in Syria. Not all of them are Muslims, and even fewer are radicals.
Perhaps ONE of them broke a bible (for reasons unknown to us). Yet you dare to say that ALL of them are radical Muslims. Xenophobia is clouding your judgement my friend....
