The law does not allow that kind of thing anywhere, but if your country does not control it, then it is your fault, not the immigrants', isn't it?
What do you mean when you say "do whatever they want"? to live as if they were common people... I mean, they are...
I mean, China probably wouldn't allow it... Nor any other country in the world....
