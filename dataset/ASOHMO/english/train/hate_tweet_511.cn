Do immigrants who are not criminals have to pay for something they did not do? Why not improve the immigration system, with stronger background checks?
You can make the statistics say whatever you want if you consider anyone born in another country a criminal. But what you say is not true....
Those numbers don't look reliable, what is your source?
