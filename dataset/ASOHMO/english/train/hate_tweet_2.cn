All immigrants pay taxes because they spend money on the country they live. If someone want to find a better future for his kids in another country that doesn't mean you have to imprison her and separate him from his children
It's not true that Illegals dump their kids at the border like road kills and refuse to unite. Migrant families want to be together and they should be
Do you have any proof that migrant families refuse to unite with their children? Why were they separated on the first place?
