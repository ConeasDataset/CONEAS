In some cases it might be true, but you are assuming that everyone who immigrates illegally does it for fun, when most do it because they have no other choice....
You claim that immigrants can never be good citizens, but your argument is the fact that you did not recognize them as citizens. Maybe the problem is not them...
If you don't recognize their citizenship, it is obvious that they will never be loyal "citizens". You are making a pun, not a good argument.
