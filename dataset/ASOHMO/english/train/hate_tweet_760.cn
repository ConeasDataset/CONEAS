If assimilating means dressing like you... it's obvious that no one wants to do it.
Not necessarily Muslims, and I don't think all of them. In any case, the reason is that this is the way they dressed all their lives, and not because they wanted to be "ghosts".
Why does it bother you that others dress the way they want? Would you like people to go around criticizing your clothes?
