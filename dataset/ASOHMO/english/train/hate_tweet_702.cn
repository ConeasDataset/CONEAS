The fact that someone does not "contribute" does not imply that they are " taking". Still, they have as much right to decide how to live their life as anyone else, don't you think?
it's hard to contribute when you have nothing, but "vile creatures who are only in it for what they can get" is a little too much, don't you think?
I don't think there is a "wrong" kind of refugee. Surely there are only those who are given the opportunity, and those who are not.
