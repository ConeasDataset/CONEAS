So you are saying that black americans problem is not racism or police abuse but illegal immigration? No one is puting illegals first, they actually have a really rough time because of xenophoous comments like yours
What hurt black americans is segregation, racism and justification of opression against other groups. This is exactly what you are doing to immigrants with your comment
Illegal immigration does not hurt black americans at all. Why would you say something like that?
