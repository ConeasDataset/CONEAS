The wall only serves to prevent illegal entry of people. If you don't want to lose your job, maybe you should do it properly.
Only some of those who were doing their job badly lost it in favor of immigrants. In any case, labor laws need to be reformed, instead of going against immigrants.
You never saw it, but it is something that happens at all levels, since always, and it has nothing to do with immigrants but with the market.
