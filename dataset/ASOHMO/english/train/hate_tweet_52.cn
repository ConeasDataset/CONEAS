The money that states spend on refugees is really low and is not the cause of children starving. Have you thought about other possible causes for this like war and military budgets, tax exemptions for multinational companies and allowance for companies to cut wages and fire employees at will? 
How do you know that people's wages cut are caused by Syrian refugees? Seems capricious to me
A billion to Syrian refugees? Really? What is you source?
