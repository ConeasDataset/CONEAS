Even if what you say is true, it is fine that those who did nothing wrong will not be punished for the others' fault...
It is not true that immigrants are murderers. There are even many of them unjustly convicted to keep the statistics.
I am very doubtful that the crime committed by immigrants is higher than that committed by non-immigrants.
