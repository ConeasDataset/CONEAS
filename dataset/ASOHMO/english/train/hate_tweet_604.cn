Are you saying that states do not have enough money to take care of people who cannot afford their basic needs? The truth is that you have a problem with "paying" for other people's food, but you don't have a problem with other people paying for your stuff
Why do you assume that refugees will remain on social welfare their whole life? it is not clear to me.
