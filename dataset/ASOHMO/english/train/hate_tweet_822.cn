We should not be charging against the immigrants or against all the Syrian people. If your problem is with ISIS, go against them, stop looking for excuses to go against innocent people....
I don't understand the relationship between ISIS and immigrants. What is the fault of those who come escaping from war?
Is Russia building up for Syria or against Syria? There is not enough information to draw conclusions. Stop misinforming people
