That the government allocates funds to solve a problem, and that immigrants are " robbing" are two very different things. You can't link them without evidence
So, do you have any proof that aliens are robbing Americans, or is that just your racism talking?
I don't know, maybe it comes out of taxes. How can you be sure it doesn't?
