Granting rights for migrants doesn't imply anyone else losing rights. Why do you say that there are no rights for white people? Can you provide an example? Haven't you though that white people migrates too?
Migrants pay taxes too and proportionally they pay higher taxes than the rest given than in many countries the most expensive taxes are the ones taxing the consumption of primary goods. Migrants are not a cost for taxpayers
Do you have any proof that it takes twelve Germans to work and pay taxes in order to fund the cost of one migrant? Because porportionally, migrants pay very high taxes on the goods they consume
