There is really no excuse to separate children from their families. Less than anything the excuse can be how people doing what they can to escape war entered the country
If someone is formally requesting asylum, he or she is subjecting herself to American law and therefore is not an illegal. It doesn't matter how she entered the country.
Do you have proof that the law states the separation of children from their family and their imprisonment? I doubt that
