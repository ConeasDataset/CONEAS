There is a big difference between " mayhem" (or some riots) and an invasion of "rapists"... Don't let your prejudices speak for you.
Why the obsession with linking refugees with rapists? You know that most of them have not even committed any kind of minor crime.
You call it mayhem just because you don't tolerate different habits, don't you?
