When you take a single case and generalize it, you are missing the big picture. Are you sure that, proportionally, there are more criminals on one side than the other? Are you sure which side?
We are going to assume that all immigrants are thieves, just because one of them is? I'm not a mathematician, but... I'm sure it doesn't work that way.
Ok, one case. What do we do about the thousands of thefts by non-migrants?
