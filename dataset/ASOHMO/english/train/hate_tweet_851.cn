It is not fair to fight crimes committed by SOME immigrants by deporting ALL of them. We should consider other ways
Just because one immigrant is a criminal does not mean they all are. How many American criminals are there, and no one thinks that all Americans are criminals
And how many migrants was victimized by Americans? Your information is biased
