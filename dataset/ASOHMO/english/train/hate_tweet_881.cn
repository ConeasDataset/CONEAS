Well... If that's their plan, then, don't worry. They clearly don't know how to achieve it...
What you say about refugees is not true. They are fleeing war! And it is not true that there are more criminals there than there are in other countries, including this one.
It's funny, because I've never seen a country where refugees are in the majority. If that's their plan, well, don't worry, they have no idea how to achieve it.
