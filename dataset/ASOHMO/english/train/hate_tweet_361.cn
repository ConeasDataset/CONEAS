Refugees are granted asylum because their life is in danger or they can not go back to their homes. It doesn't matter if they have a job or not, you are not wasting money, you are saving someone
You assume they don't want to have a job and they want to live from social walfare. Many times they can not work or people don't want to hire them. We are talking about people escaping extreme situations, they do what they can.
I think those numbers are made up to make immigrants look bad
