Instead of making up hypothetical situations to test me, why don't we ask ourselves where your hatred against immigrants comes from?
If a group of immigrants in the Netherlands started fighting, killed security forces and demanded land to form their own government, we would have to analyze the case, and see how to proceed. As long as it doesn't happen, it's just a hypothetical example you are using to legitimize your xenophobia...
Are you saying that something like that happened? tell me about it, but I'm sure you're making it up...
