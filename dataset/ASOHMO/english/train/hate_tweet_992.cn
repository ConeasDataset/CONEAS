I don't see how a wall would prevent rape. It would only make life more difficult for immigrant workers.
There is no more relation between rapists and immigrants than some coincidences, just as with no-migrants.
That's terrible, but whether the rapist is an immigrant or a native doesn't change anything, you're focusing on the wrong angle.
