You are criticizing liberals because they call you racist if you don't think like them and them you are calling them anti-americans just because they don't think like you. Do you realize that in the best scenario you are the same thing you criticise?
Why do you say that illegal immigration hurts American workers? That seems just like a xenophobic hypothesis not backed up by any evidence
Are you sure that liberals call people racist because they don't believe in open borders and illegal immigration? Or maybe it's because the people they call like that are racist?
