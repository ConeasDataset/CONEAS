Just because someone you don't like has something doesn't mean you should have the same thing. Did you accomplish all the requirements that housing requires?
If they legally complied with all the steps required by law, well, I don't see any tragedy in that.
What is the problem? Are the houses only for those who were born here? I don't know who lied to you like that.
