Are you saying that if you are young and healthy and not a children, elderly or women then you can't be a refugee?
People can be refugees and also economic migrants. Wars cause severe economic crises among other terrible things and economic crises can also cause wars. They are people escaping for their lives and we should help.
Do you have proof to support that young fighting age men are the vast majority of the ones escaping a war and not women, children and the elderly? Because that  sounds fake
