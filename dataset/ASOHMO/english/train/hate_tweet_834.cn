Assimilation goes both ways, just as it did when your ancestors "invaded" this land. Unless you want to start by leaving here.....
Why do you say they "do not assimilate"? Is it that they don't respect the laws, or do you just don't like the food they cook, or that they speak another language?
When your ancestors came here they also faced other cultures. And believe me, it was much less peaceful than today. You don't want to relive that
