Just because immigrants were given jobs does not mean that anything has been surrendered. You are assuming that no jobs were given to any natives, and you don't know if that is really the case.
It is very common that people don't want to take jobs because of a "social status" issue. And then they complain when immigrants take them. What hypocrisy.
Why should only European French citizens be hired? This is ridiculous and discriminatory
