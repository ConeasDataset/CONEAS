You are justifying leaving people, children included, in the desert without food because "otherwise more illegal refugees will come". Why are you so full of hate?
Refugees are legal migrants claiming asylum - in other words, asking for help. Calling them illegal means not only refusing to help but also disrespecting them when they are vulnerable
As long as our neighbours continue to have different problems in their society there will be immigrants. As long as wars continue around the world there will be refugees. Separating them from their children won't reduce immigration. It will only make us look like the monsters we are
