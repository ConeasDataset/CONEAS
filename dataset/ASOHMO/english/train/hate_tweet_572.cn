Ok, but no more or less than native drunk drivers...
Well, we know that some people don't follow the law, but you can't say that ALL immigrants drive drunk.
Who assures you that they were immigrants? How can you know that ALL OF THEM were drunk? You saw what you wanted to see, or what your father wanted you to "see"...
