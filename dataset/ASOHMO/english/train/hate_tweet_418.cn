I hope the authorities do not take these "locals" too seriously.
Maybe one or two of them did, but can you judge all of them? Can you judge all Americans just because some of them are neo-Nazis?
All locals? We're going to take the opinion of 2 or 3 xenophobes seriously just because you agree with them?
