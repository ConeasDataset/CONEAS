Supporting the human right to migrate has nothing to do with supporting "radical Muslims". Macro-politics is way more complex than you think.
Not all immigrants are radical Muslims. Some are not even Muslim.
It just doesn't make sense. We've been letting people in forever, and we've never had a problem with radical Muslims. Why would we have them now that they are a minority?
