Consensus won't happen because racism and xenophobia should not and will not be tolerated
Bad wages and lack of universal healthcare are because cheap employers and austerity policies. Immigrants have the worst wages and most of them don't have access to health care so don't try to blame them for any pronblem societies might have
How do you know that wages and health care are not possible with migrants? Maybe if you stop spending so much money on enforcing borders and building walls you could have better wages and healthcare for all
