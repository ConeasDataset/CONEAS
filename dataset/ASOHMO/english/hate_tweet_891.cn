You are not going to end crime by ending immigration. You're only going to end a few crimes committed by immigrants. But what about ALL THE OTHERS? And what about all the other immigrants? You know, the non-criminals?
Of course, because they are always immigrants or non-whites. Tell me, have you at least checked the info? Of course you didn't
And what is the relationship? Are you sure he was an immigrant? And you think that had something to do with him stealing? Well, you're wrong.
