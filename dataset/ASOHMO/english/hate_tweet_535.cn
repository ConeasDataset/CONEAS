You're generalizing. You're going to prevent immigration because of something ONE person did?
That is sad. But could you be so xenophobic to think that ALL immigrants are like that? That's even sadder
Why does the media focus on the fact that they are immigrants only when they are criminals and not when they make contributions to society, with doctors or scientists, for example?
