So because they don't act "normal" according to you you want to kick them out? Let me tell you what is not "normal": xenophobia and racism
Refugees are normal people from a different country. They are here because they are escaping war or social disasters, but besides that they are like anyone else
The only one that should act "normal" is you, and that means keeping your xenophobous tweets to yourself
