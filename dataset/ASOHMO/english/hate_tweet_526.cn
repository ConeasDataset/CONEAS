Don't worry, that money will go into the pockets of citizens, in exchange for doing their job, just like anywhere else in the world.
Who will pay depends on many factors, as it always has. Why are you suddenly upset?
where did you get that someone else is going to pay for that? At worst it will be with the tax money you already pay (or should be paying).
