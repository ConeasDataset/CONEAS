You contradict yourself. If no business wants to hire illegals, how is it that they "take jobs from U.S. citizens"?
The Daca's have the right to work like everyone else. Besides, the Daca's are Americans, even if some people do not want to recognize it....
There is nothing like "taking someone else's job". You have the job, you either earn it or you lose it. That's all there is to it.
