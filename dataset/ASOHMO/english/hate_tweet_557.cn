Do you think everyone thinks like you? I doubt that most of them vote as you say...
I don't see the relationship between more refugees and less welfare and fine life. What are you afraid of?
I don't understand why more refugees equals more weapons, and why no refugees would mean a happy life. Happy for whom? For xenophobes who believe that the problems of neighboring countries don't matter?
