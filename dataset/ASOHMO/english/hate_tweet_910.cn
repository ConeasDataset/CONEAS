I don't think it's a "good job". If anything, it is a failure. They failed culturally assimilating foreigners.
The "refugee crisis" is a way of saying that there are a lot of people you don't like. There is no real crisis.
And these protests, where did they happen? How many people were there? Are you sure they are Germans? Why are there no sources?
