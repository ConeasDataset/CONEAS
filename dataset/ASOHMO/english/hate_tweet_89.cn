You are claiming to speak on behalf of the people but are just another xenophobic autoritarian. The UK vote will be won by whoever can offer a solution to peoples problems. Stoping immigration won't solve anything

I don't think that's the question that most people is worried about. Maybe it's just you and your xenophobic friends?
