If one immigrant does something bad, they are all bad. What happens then when the criminals are Americans?
Do you think all foreigners are like that? or do you think immigrating makes you like that? Or do you think no American is that crazy? Or you just don't watch the news?
The problem with your statement is that you are assuming that he does it BECAUSE he is an immigrant and not in spite of it.
