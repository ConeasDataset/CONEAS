You are assuming that the law actually works. The reality is that the "extra burden on taxpayers" is a myth.
The fact that there are more or less immigrants does not make you pay more or less taxes. That is a fallacy
Do you have any idea how many laws existed 100 years ago that may have made sense at the time, but no longer do? You would be surprised...
