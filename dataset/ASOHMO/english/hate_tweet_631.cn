I don't see the link. Are you directly responsible for what you vote for? Ah no, it is true that the vote is secret, at least when it is convenient for you and your "agenda"...

One man one vote, even applies to electing the president. Why are you trying to restrict it only to things you do not disagree with? That's not democratic.
