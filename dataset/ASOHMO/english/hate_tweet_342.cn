I don't think you are making much sense right now but I can tell you that migration is normal and it is not something to be afraid of
Immigration is not damaging. Only those afraid of discovering other cultures may see it that way. You should try talking to them and see they are people just like you and me
I don't understand what you are trying to say. It doesn't make sense
