It may be unfair, but wasting funds to solve the problem in this way, instead of using them to allow more immigrants to enter legally, is even more unfair....
In fact illegal immigrants are persecuted and deported, you already know that.... 
In fact, they are not allowed, otherwise they would not be "illegal"... That the deportation policies are not so tough is a different thing...
