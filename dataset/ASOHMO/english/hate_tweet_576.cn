When you propose to take countermeasures you are charging innocent immigrants for the crimes of a few. How would you feel if the same were done to the natives?
Ok, but he did it because he's a criminal, not because he's an alien....  I think we are missing the point here
Did he at least commit the crime for which he was convicted? Or did they need a scapegoat and took the immigrant?
