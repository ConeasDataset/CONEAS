Diversity and immigration are not necessarily the same thing. Besides, no one wants to "ruin" the country where they live.
I don't think anyone would mind living in a "glorious" country. The problem is, when "glorious" means to attack those who are different
Nope, diversity means accepting that we are not all the same. Particularly, that not everyone is the same as you.
