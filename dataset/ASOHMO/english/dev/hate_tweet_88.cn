What you are saying makes no sense. If Obama is an empty chair he should be powerless to defraud anyone
Most immigrants want to improve their quality of life through hard work. That seems to be the opposite of defrauding the american dream
I don't really see how Clint Eastwood speech could confirm that Obama is an empty chair. You are just coarsingly adapting reality to your convinience
