Do you have any proof that building the wall is going to stop drug cartels from getting into US? Do you have any proof that persecuting migrants have reduced drugs traffic?
Your argument to build the wall is that all migrants are part of bloodthirsty drug cartels and disease carriers? That sound just like predjudice
Do you have any proof that the wall is going to keep drug cartels and disease carriers out?
