Just because you think they shouldn't be here it means that they are claiming fake asylum?
People claiming asylum are not fake, there are millions of refugees escaping wars and there is people checking that they are who they say they are
I don't agree. We should welcome everyone claiming asylum and let them stay. If you send people back to a war knowing they will probably die then you are a murderer
