Are you suggesting that insecurity is caused all around the world exclusively by refugees? You must be mistaken
Refugees don't provoke insecurity or unsafeness. Refugees are victims of wars and crimes committed by states and armies
How do you know that Poland haven't accepted refugees? Or you only notice those in need when they bother you?
