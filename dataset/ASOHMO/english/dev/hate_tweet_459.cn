If the difference is so big, why is it not reflected in the prison system? Perhaps we are being too soft on our own.
You are saying that immigrants are more likely to end up in prison. But have you ever thought that maybe it's not because they commit crimes, but simply because they are immigrants?
If you think it's because all immigrants (or at least most of them) are criminals, and the corruption of our penal system has nothing to do with it, then you are very wrong, my friend.
