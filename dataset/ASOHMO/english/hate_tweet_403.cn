Just because a refugee commits an atrocity is not a sufficient reason to generalize.  Don't you think that talking about "Sharia" is a bit hasty?
You know that not all Muslims are like that. On the other hand, every day some crazy Christian does the same thing, are you going to complain about that too, or are you only bothered by Muslims?
How do you know he did it for that reason? Maybe he's just crazy, and that he's a Muslim could be a mere coincidence.
