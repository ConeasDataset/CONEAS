Are you sure that immigrants are involved in that? I mean, if you assume it, you can't conclude it, it goes against logic....
Not all migrants are rapists. Most of them have not even committed any other crime. You cannot base your argument on such a lie.
Your xenophobia is not sufficient proof of anything. On what basis do you claim that the perpetrators are immigrants?
