Come on! There is a huge distance between being a somewhat disorganized city and being a "slum city."
You assume that migrants don't follow traffic rules, and even if they do, what does that have to do with increased crime rates? because I don't see the relationship...
It's strange that the city is so disorganized in comparison to how it used to be, and yet no one but you has noticed it, you know?
