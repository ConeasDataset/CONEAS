The only ones expecting aggresion and overwhelming of Spain are the xenophobous who attack migrants and anyone different with their hate speech
Migrants are not aggressive and are not overwhelming Spain. Migrants are poor people looking for a better future
I don't think there are really aggressive male migrants overwhelming Spain. I think that just the imagination of a couple of xenophobous racists
