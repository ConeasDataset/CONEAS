You are complaining about immigrants being an excesive expense for the state and you want to build a wall that is going to cost dozens times more? That doesn't make any sense
Illegals are taxpayers too. They pay taxes on everything they buy and their spend a bigger percentage of their income on taxable stuff
Really? How much money do Sanctuary Cities cost to the taxpayers? I think you are exagerating just because you are xenophobous
