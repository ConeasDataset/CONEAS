The fact that a Somali refugee committed a crime doesn't mean that all refugees are criminals. Irony is a good resource when  used smartly. It's not your case though
Are you implicating that all refugees are attackers or criminals? I think you are just showing off your xenophobia
Do you have any proof that this Somali refugee was known to the police? What is that supposed to prove?
