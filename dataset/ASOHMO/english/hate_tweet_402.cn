People have always emigrated, and this has never generated big problems. Why should be a will to stop it?
There are "criminal elements" transporting refugees according to whom? or is it just an excuse to denigrate immigrants?
Why should they be able to prohibit the entry of refugees into their territory? Is it not a human right to emigrate?
