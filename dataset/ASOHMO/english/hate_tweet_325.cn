So we need to build the wall not because of the immigrants but to fight the globalists and avoid falling into a distopia where there is one super oppresive global superstate? And immigrants are part of this plan too? Are you sure you're taking your meds?                   

Really? You think immigrants are brought by "the globalists" to foment chaos and social mayhem as part of a secret plan to create a superstate? Chaos and social mayhem is not on immigrants to blame but on the xenophobous and intolerant people full of hate suh as yourself
