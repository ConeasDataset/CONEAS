Just because someone does not have a university degree does not make a country "third world". Is everyone in your country a doctor, or it is a third world country?
Do you really believe that ALL refugees are rapists? Your xenophobia is unbelievable
It is not true that accepting "third world" immigrants will bring us problems, just as accepting war refugees never brought us war.
