Some italians are calling for people to be deported based on that they don't like them praying in the street. But in Rome and the Vatican Christians block the street all the time. I think they need a better excuse for xenophobia.

<pad> I don't think it's a good idea to send all migrants back to where they came from.</s>

And how exactly do you expect to deport all immigrants without "draining our limited resources"? By asking them to "please, leave"?

<pad> I don't know why they were apprehended. I'm not sure why they were deported.</s>

I really doubt that crime can drain all our resources. In any case, we have a budget problem rather than a crime problem.
