I don't understand, are you accusing refugees of not being refugees? Then they don't bother you, do they?

<pad><extra_id_20> I don't think that's a good thing, but it's not a bad thing. It's just that they're a bunch of people who don't have anything to do with it. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'm sure that's what they're doing.</s>

@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
In many cases they are street sellers because they are not allowed to work on other things. It's not really their fault

<pad><extra_id_20> I don't know what you mean by "third world illegal immigrants." I mean, if you're talking about immigrants, you're referring to people who aren't immigrants. I mean, they're people who are not immigrants. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it's not a good thing. It's just that they're not immigrants. They're just people who don't want to be a part of the world. I'd say that's not true. I've never seen such a thing before, but I'm sure it's true.</s>

The relationship between Arabs and rape is a xenophobic invention.

That is not true, most try to enter the country legally. Some do, others are rejected just because of their religion, which by the way, is illegal.
